	<h1>Data </h1>
	<p>Video Links from CI course on data for my own ref</p>


	<h2>What is data</h2>

	<h2>Entities</h2>
	<p>An entity is a data-based representation of a real-world object (a person), and an attribute is a specific piece
		of information belong to an entity (a name)</p>

	<h2>How is data organised</h2>

	<p>a data store: Acts as a repository to hold an organization's data After filling it with data a data store becomes
		an archive that can then be searched.</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2>Where data comes from</h2>
	<p>Records, fields and metadata : A record is the set of data stored about a particular instance of an entity. A
		field is a single piece of data in a record that corresponds to an attribute. Metadata is any data that
		describes other data. How do we use it? Use records, fields and metadata to record and describe the contents of
		a data store</p>

	<h2>Aquiring data</h2>
	<p>Manual data entry or a bulk import</p>

	<h2>CRUD operations</h2>
	<p>Create Read Update Delete operations to be carried out against a data store</p>

	<h2>Data Access Patterns</h2>
	<p>Ways of interacting with a data store, a pattern of interation on the data stores primary usage, based on
		applications needs.</p>

	<h2>Data store types</h2>
	<p>Data store types : file based / databases</p>

	<iframe width="801" height="451" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vTfLDmMo81E" frameborder="0"
		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2>Files based</h2>
	<p>data stored in simple files Use it when working with simple data such as data exported from Excel sheets or other
		comma separated value (CSV) formatted data</p>

	<iframe width="801" height="451" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LKHKdQ3U-MA" frameborder="0"
		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen></iframe>




	<h2>JSON & XML</h2>
	<p>Key Value Pairs: Use XML or JSON structure in particular when data originates in nested formats</p>

	<iframe width="801" height="451" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lJO84kXyiEc" frameborder="0"
		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2>Databases :</h2>
	<p> A databsse management system :A DBMS manages all access to the data providing security reliability ease of
		administration and performance, Use a DBMS when working with data that requires rapid retrieval and modification
	</p>

		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen></iframe>


	<h2>Context of a database in your software</h2>
	<p>Using data as part of an application
		. Data provides the meaning for your application's existence

		How? Store data at rest in a DBMS. Manipulate data in motion as part of executing the application's business
		rules. Represent data as presented in the user interface (UI)
	</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2>Relational Databases SQL structured query language</h2>
	<p>Represents data in table form. Relationships can be created and maintained among tables. Use a relational
		database for highly structured, non-nested data formats</p>

		allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
		allowfullscreen></iframe>






	<h2>No SQL: Document oriented Databases MongoDB etc</h2>
	<p>A non-relational DBMS: Provides a means of working with high volumes of non-relational data usually in JSON or
		XML format: Use a document-oriented DBMS as a way of grouping collections of similar formatted document data.
	</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2> NoSQL And Key-Value Databases
	</h2>
	<p>Key-value DBMS
		: Stores data in key-value pairs when the actual data (the value) can be identified by an associated key. : Use
		a key-value based DBMS when working with data that doesn't have a very well defined structure
	</p>

	<h2> Specialised Databases & Summary Of Overview
	</h2>
	<p>Specialist database systems : Provide specialization or niche storage formats

		: Consider these options based on very specific requierements and where an RDBMS is not effective

	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>graph database ie facebook suggested friends</li>
		<li>timeseries database ie stock prices</li>
		<li>geospatial database - maps</li>
	</ul>

	<h2> Relational Database Design Overview</h2>
	<p>Designing a database : worthwhile spending time doing this as it is hard to change afterwards.

		the steps required to determine the structure of a database, use this activity to create a data model</p>
	<p>data : entity relationship model ER model</p>
	<p>preparing the database to how you want to use it! very important.</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>





	<h2> Conceptual Design Phase -IMPORTANT for any dev project.
	</h2>
	<p>A series of activities in a database design process. Determines all the entities that are important to business
		implementing business rules. Represent your application data at a conceptual level by creating an
		Entity-Relationship (ER) data model. many to many one to many ! remember hydrasound how i used that with studios
		events etc. This is an example of appoaching design phase.
	</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2> Logical Design Phase
	</h2>
	<p>A set of activities that take place on the outputs of the conceptual design phase. The process of defining the
		higher level entities to be stored as tables. It is a refining of the ER model created during the conceptual
		phase.
		Use the logical design phase to determine the data types, primary and foreign keys to be used among the tables


	</p>
	<p>examples:</p>
	<ul>

		<li>int</li>
		<li>varChar</li>
		<li>text</li>
		<li>Bool</li>

	</ul>

	<p>defining a scheme for the logical data model: </p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>



	<h2> Null Values
	</h2>
	<p>A representation of data when it's type is unknown

	</p>
	<p>Allows the creation of a record where the expected data type in a field can be empty. Use the null value type
		when there is the possibility of a record field having an empty value.
	</p>

		allowfullscreen></iframe>





	<h2>Physical Data Model</h2>
	<p>The last and most concrete phase of the ER modelling process
		Considers how the tables in our database will be stored and accessed

		Use this to determine what server hardware and indexes might be required.

	<h2>Normalisation</h2>
	<p>A process of optimizing the organization of data
		Normalization is concerned with breaking up data into tables to stop it from being redundant
		Apply normalization to reduce unnecessary disk space usage, speed up data access and minimize the risk of
		corrupting your data.

<h2>SQL </h2>
<p>It allows the communication and the provision of instructions to a relational database
Use SQL to create, access and modify a database, it's tables, records and fields.
